I bought a 3d printer kit from a company in the old eastern block pruasa i3 arduiino maxi with 1.4 ramps. I built the mechanical  part of the printer within 2 days. I wired up the motors stops hot bed and hotend over the next few days.
I installed prontoprint and marlin. I am havingproblems configuring marlin. I can send all 3 axis,s to the home position
all stop on the stops. But I cannot move the motors in either direction. Can any one give me the correct settings for arduino and My printer running. I have contacted the firm i bought the printer kit of but they have a policy of no
tech backup.
